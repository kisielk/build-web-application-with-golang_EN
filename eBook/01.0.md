# 1 Go environment configuration

Welcome to the world of Go, let's start exploring!

Go is a fast-compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent system programming language, it has following advantages:

- Compiles a big project with few seconds.
- Provides a easy-analysis software development model, avoid most of problems caused by c-style header files.
- Static language, doesn't have levels in its type system, users don't need to speed much time dealing with relations between types, more like a lightweight OO-language.
- Complete garbage-collected language, give basic support of concurrency and communication.
- Designed for multi-core computers.

Go is a compiled language, it combines development efficiency of interpreted or dynamic languages and security of static languages. It is going to be the language for the modern multi-core computers with networking. For these purposes, there are some problems that have to be resolved in language itself,such as a rich-expressive lightweight type system, concurrent and garbage-collected, strictly regulated. These problems cannot be dealing with packages or tools for a long time, so the Go comes out.

In this chapter, we will show you how to install Go and its configuration.
