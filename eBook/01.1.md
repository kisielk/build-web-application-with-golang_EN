#1.1 Installation
##Three ways to install Go
There are many ways to install Go environment in your computer, you can choose any one you like. We only show you three most common ways as following.

- Install from source code.
	- This the most popular way of installation for people who are familiar with Unix or Unix-like systems, especially when you are a developer.
- Use standard installation package.
	- Go team provides convenient installation packages for Windows, Linux, Mac and other operating systems. This is the best way for new beginners.
- Use third-party tools.
	- There are many third-party tools for installing Go, like apt-get in Ubuntu, homebrew in Mac, etc. It requires you to know how to use these tools.
	
In case you want to install more than one version of Go in one computer, you should take a look at the tool called [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). It is the best tool I've seen so far for achieving this job, otherwise you have to know how to deal with this problem by yourself.

##Install from source code
Because some parts of Go are written by Plan 9 C and AT&T Compilation, you have to install C compilers before you get into next step.

In Mac, once you install the Xcode, you have already had the compilers.

In Unix-like systems, you need install gcc or some other compilers. For example, you can install compilers by executing this command in your terminal `sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev` in Ubuntu.

In Windows, you need to install MinGW before you install gcc. Don't forget to configure environment variables after finishing installation.( ***Everything looks like this means it's commented by translator: If you are using 64-bit Windows, you would better install 64-bit version of MinGW*** )

Go team uses [Mercurial][(http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/)] to manage source code, so you need to install this tool in order to download Go source code.

At this point, execute following command to clone Go source code, and start compiling.( ***It will clone source code to you current directory, switch your work path before you continue. Depends on your computer performance, it usually takes one minute, and one hour in Raspberry Pi*** )

	hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
	cd go/src
	./all.bash 
	
The installation will not be succeed until you see "ALL TESTS PASSED" on your screen.

The command above is Unix-style. It's not very different in Windows by running the all.bat.

If you are using Windows, installation package will set environment variables automatically. In Unix-like systems, you need to set these variables manually as following.( ***If your Go version is greater than 1.0, you don't have to set $GOBIN, and it will automatically be related to your $GOPATH/bin, which we will talk about in the next section***)

    export GOROOT=$HOME/go
    export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

If you see picture similar to the following, you're all set.

Once you see Usage information of Go, it means you succeed install Go in your computer. If it says no such command, you'd better check if your $PATH environment variables contains installation path of Go.

##Use standard installation package
Go has one-click installation packages in every operating system, these packages will install Go in path /usr/local/go (c:\Go in Windows) as default. Of course you can change it, but you also need to change all the environment variables manually as showed above.

###How to check your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit?
Our next step is depended on your operating system type, so we should check it before we download the standard installation package.

If you are using Windows, press `Win+R` and then run the cmd tool, type command `systeminfo` and it shows some useful information just few seconds. Find the line with "system type", if you see "x64-based PC" means your operating system is 64-bit, 32-bit otherwise.

I strongly recommend you download 64-bit version of package if you are Mac users because Go is no longer support pure 32-bit processors in Mac OS.

Linux users can just type `uname -a` in the terminal to see system information.
64-bit operating system will show

    <some description> x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    // some machines such as Ubuntu 10.04 will show as following
    x86_64 GNU/Linux

32-bit operating system will show

    <some description> i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

###Mac
Go to the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), go1.0.3.darwin-386.pkg for 32-bit users and go1.0.3.darwin-amd64.pkg for 64-bit users. All the way to the end by clicking "next", `~/go/bin` will be added to $PATH when you finish installation. Now you open the terminal and type `go`, you will see the picture as showed in figure 1.1.

###Linux
Go to the [download page]((http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), go1.0.3.linux-386.tar.gz for 32-bit users and go1.0.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz for 64-bit users. Suppose you want install Go in path `$GO_INSTALL_DIR`, uncompressed `tar.gz` to the path by using command `tar zxvf go1.0.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C $GO_INSTALL_DIR`. And then, set your $PATH `export PATH=$PATH:$GO_INSTALL_DIR/go/bin`. Now you open the terminal and type `go`, you will see the picture as showed in figure 1.1.

###Windows
Go to the [download page]((http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), go1.0.3.windows-386.msi for 32-bit users and go1.0.3.windows-amd64.msi for 64-bit users. All the way to the end by clicking "next", `c:/go/bin` will be added to `path`. Now you open the cmd tool and type `go`, you will see the picture as showed in figure 1.1.

##Use third-party tools

###GVM
gvm is a Go multi-version control tool developed by third-party, like rvm in ruby. It's quite easy to use it. Install gvm by typing following command in your terminal.

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)

Then we can install Go by following commands.

    gvm install go1.0.3
    gvm use go1.0.3

When the process finished, you're all set.

###apt-get
Ubuntu is the most popular desktop release version of Linux, it uses `apt-get` manage packages, we can install Go use following commands.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install golang-stable

###homebrew
homebrew is a software manage tool commonly used in Mac to manage softwares, just type following command to install Go.

    brew install go
